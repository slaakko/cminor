    <h2>
        5 Source File Character Encoding
    </h2>

    <p>
        The Cminor compiler assumes that source files have implicit UTF-8 encoding.
        UTF-8 byte order mark EF BB BF can be used in the start of a source file,
        but it's not required.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the string literals contained in source files are converted from UTF-8 to 
        UTF-32 representation internally. The Cminor string and character types have internal UTF-32 encoding.
    </p>

    <p>
        The output encoding of strings and characters is UTF-8.
    </p>

    <h3 id="chinese">
        5.1 Hello World in Chinese
    </h3>

    <p>
        Here's the contents of program <span class="code">encoding.cminor</span> that prints 
        word "Hello" followed by the word "world" in chinese:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/encoding/encoding.cminor.html" height="320px" width="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        It is good practice that programs containing I/O or other code that can fail handle exceptions by using <span class="code">try</span> statements.
