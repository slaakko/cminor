    <title>Hashing</title>

    <p>
        In garbage-collected environment object's memory address cannot be used as a hash code, 
        because an object might move to a different memory addess due to GC. 
        This means that the same object might hash to different locations before and after GC 
        is performed.
    </p>

    <p>
        This problem is solved in Cminor by giving each object a 64-bit random hash code when the object
        is created and ensuring that the given hash code follows the object even when GC is performed.
