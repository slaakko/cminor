    <h2>7 Larger Example &ndash; Creating a Desk Calculator</h2>

    <p>
        To illustrate features of Cminor language in a somewhat more realistic context,
        we go through creating a desk calculator in this chapter.

    <h3 id="exceptions">
        7.1 Error Handling
    </h3>

    <p>
        Error handling in Cminor programs is best implemented using exceptions, because 
        exceptions separate concerns of detecting an error condition and handling it using 
        close to minimal code devoted to error handling.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, in the following main function, there are two nested try blocks,
        where the inner block handles known errors caused by incomplete or otherwise 
        invalid input &ndash; <span class="code">ParsingException</span>, 
        trying to divide by zero &ndash; <span class="code">DivisionByZeroException</span>, 
        referring to a nonexisting variable &ndash; <span class="code">VariableNotFoundException</span>,
        or trying to parse badly formatted string to a number &ndash; <span class="code">System.ConversionException</span>. 
        These user errors are handled by printing just the error message represented by the
        <span class="code">Message</span> property of <span class="code">System.Exception</span> class.
    </p>

    <p>
        The outer try block handles all remaining errors, or errors that "should not happen".
        The <span class="code">System.Exception.ToString()</span> method prints the 
        call stack along with the error message, so that exact source code position of the error can be found.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main loop consists of reading a line of input from the console, parsing and processing it, and also handling errorneous input.
        Then next line of input is read and processed, and so on, until user enters EOF followed by an ENTER to end the loop.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Here are the exception classes for various error conditions. In Cminor as in C# all exception classes must be derived from the
        <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Exception.cminor.html">System.Exception</a></span> class. By catching <span class="code">System.Exception</span> class all exceptions can be handled.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nonmemberfunctions">
        7.2 Nonmember Functions
    </h3>

    <p>
        Unlike C#, Cminor contains nonmember functions, also called "free functions". They are functionally equivalent to <em>static</em> member functions in C#.
        Nonmember functions can be used to implement program logic that does not naturally belong to any class. 
        Also operator functions <strong>operator+</strong>, <strong>operator-</strong>, <strong>operator*</strong>, and so on, are required to be nonmember functions in Cminor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following code creates an object of a <span class="code">Scanner</span> class that is used to break up the input into <em>tokens</em> and also to skip any whitespace in input.
        Then the first token is read. If it is a <span class="code">PrintToken</span> the current contents of variables are printed.
        Otherwise if it is a variable name token, and the next token is '=', an expression is parsed and its value is assigned to a variable.
        Otherwise the input is rewound and an expression is parsed and its value is printed:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/parse.cminor.html" height="780px" width="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        An expression of the form "<span class="code">x <strong>is</strong> C</span>", tests if the class of expression <span class="code">x</span> is equal to class <span class="code">C</span>,
        or derived from it. If that is the case the value of expression "<span class="code">x <strong>is</strong> C</span>" is <span class="code"><strong>true</strong></span>,
        otherwise it's <span class="code"><strong>false</strong></span>. The language implementation of <strong>is</strong>-expression in Cminor does not need to crawl the class hierarchy,
        because in intermediate code link time, each class is assigned an identifier of type <span class="code"><strong>ulong</strong></span> that is a product of prime factors.
        The <strong>is</strong> test is reduced to an integer divisibility test: <br />"<span class="code">(id of class of x) % (id of class C) == 0"</span>.
        This scheme is invented by Michael Gibbs and Bjarne Stroustrup and described in the article <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/fast_dynamic_casting.pdf">Fast Dynamic Casting</a>
        authored by them. The implementation of this scheme in Cminor is simpler than implementation for C++ described in the article because Cminor lacks multiple inheritance.
    </p>

    <h3 id="inheritance">
        7.3 Inheritance
    </h3>

    <p>
        As already mentioned Cminor lacks multiple inheritance, but it allows a class to implement any number of <em>interfaces</em>. 
        However in this simple program interfaces are not used.
        Here are the various token classes. The <span class="code">Token</span> class is <em>abstract</em> meaning an object of it cannot be created. 
        A class that contains abstract member functions, must also be declared abstract.
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/token.cminor.html" height="1000px" width="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <h3 id="properties">
        7.4 Properties
    </h3>

    <p>
        In Cminor a class may have <em>properties</em> that can be read-only &ndash; having a <em>getter</em>, write-only &ndash; having a <em>setter</em>, 
        or read-write &ndash; having both getter and a setter. In the code above classes <span class="code">NumberToken</span>, <span class="code">VariableNameToken</span> and 
        <span class="code">OperatorToken</span> have read-only properties. Unlike in C#, properties in Cminor cannot be polymorphic &ndash; <em>virtual</em>, abstract or <em>overridden</em>.
        Properties can be static in Cminor, however. Static properties are accessed using <span class="code">ClassName.PropertyName</span> notation.
    </p>

    <h3 id="boxing">
        7.5 Boxing and Unboxing
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Like in C#, values of <a href="../langref/basic_type.html">basic value types</a> are automatically <em>boxed</em> when needed, 
        meaning an object containing a value of a basic value type is created. For example, statement <span class="code"><strong>object</strong> x = 1;</span> creates
        an object of <span class="code">BoxedInt8</span> class and places an <span class="code"><strong>sbyte</strong></span> value 1 into that object.
        The reverse operation of <em>unboxing</em> converts an object of boxed value type back to an instance of basic value type. 
        Unboxing must be performed explicitly by using a <em>cast</em>. For example, <span class="code"><strong>sbyte</strong> y = <strong>cast</strong>&lt;sbyte&gt;(x);</span>.
        If the type of <span class="code">x</span> is not <span class="code">BoxedInt8</span>, an exception of class <span class="code">System.InvalidCastException</span> is thrown.
        The Cminor system library source file <a href="../code/system/BoxedTypes.cminor.html">BoxedTypes.cminor</a> contains the boxed types and 
        their operations. Explicit type conversion, <em>casting</em> is performed using syntax <span class="code"><strong>cast</strong>&lt;sbyte&gt;(x)</span>, not using the 
        C# syntax <span class="code">(<strong>sbyte</strong>)x</span>, because this way casts can be found from source code with search tools using regular expressions.
    </p>

    <h3 id="unicode">
        7.6 Unicode
    </h3>

    <p>
        Cminor contains minimal support for Unicode, not perfect, but usable at least in western Europe countries where the author is from.
        The support is implemented as static member functions of the <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/BoxedTypes.cminor.html">System.BoxedChar</a></span> class.
        For example, <span class="code"><strong>char</strong>.IsLetter(x)</span> returns true if character <span class="code">x</span>
        has Unicode letter character category. The following <span class="code">Scanner</span> class illustrates using character classification functions
        <span class="code"><strong>char</strong>.IsLetter(<strong>char</strong>)</span> and <span class="code"><strong>char</strong>.IsNumber(<strong>char</strong>)</span>
        and also parsing a <span class="code"><strong>double</strong></span> to a string &ndash; <span class="code"><strong>double</strong>.Parse(<strong>string</strong>)</span>:

    </div>

    <h3 id="collections">
        7.7 Generic Collections
    </h3>

    <p>
        Cminor system library has the following generic collections implemented as templates:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/List.cminor.html">System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt;</a></span> is a class template 
                for storing a sequence of values that can be accessed with subscripting operator <span class="code"><strong>[]</strong></span> in constant time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Set.cminor.html">System.Collections.Generic.Set&lt;T&gt;</a></span> is a class template for storing unique elements in a 
                <a href="../code/system/RBTree.cminor.html">red-black tree</a>. The elements must form a set ordered by the less than operator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Map.cminor.html">System.Collections.Generic.Map&lt;KeyType, ValueType&gt;</a></span> is an associative collection 
                for storing unique key-value pairs in a <a href="../code/system/RBTree.cminor.html">red-black tree</a>. The keys must form a set ordered by the less than operator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/HashSet.cminor.html">System.Collections.Generic.HashSet&lt;T&gt;</a></span> 
                is a class template for storing unique elements in a <a href="../code/system/Hashtable.cminor.html">hash table</a>.
                The elements must implement virtual <span class="code">GetHashCode</span> member function.
                This condition is satisfied for all class types and boxed value types, but the default implementation for class types can be overridden if needed.
                The default implementation in the <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Object.cminor.html">System.Object</a></span> class generates an artificial random hash code for the object in the object creation time.
                The hash code stays the same during the lifetime of the object though the object may be moved by the garbage collector.
                For this reason the memory address of the object is not used as a hash code, as is the case for pointer types in C++ for example.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/HashMap.cminor.html">System.Collections.Generic.HashMap&lt;KeyType, ValueType&gt;</a></span> is an associative collection 
                for storing unique key-value pairs in a <a href="../code/system/Hashtable.cminor.html">hash table</a>.
                The keys must implement virtual <span class="code">GetHashCode</span> member function. This condition is satisfied for all class types and boxed value types, 
                but the default implementation for class types can be overridden if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Stack.cminor.html">System.Collections.Generic.Stack&lt;T&gt;</a></span> 
                is a stack adapter class template implemented in terms of <span class="code">System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;T&gt;</span>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The calculator stores the values of variables in a <span class="code">System.Collections.Generic.Map&lt;string, double&gt;</span>
        by mapping the name of the variable to the value of the variable.
        If the key of an element is not already found in the map, the subscripting operator of the map inserts the element to the map.
        Otherwise, if the key is already found in the map, the new value replaces the old value.
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/symbols.cminor.html" height="600px" width="720px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        Each collection class implements an interface called <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Enumerator.cminor">Enumerable</a></span>. 
        An <span class="code">Enumerable</span> class has a member function called <span class="code">GetEnumerator()</span> that returns an 
        object of a class that in turn implements an interface called <span class="code"><a href="../code/system/Enumerator.cminor">Enumerator</a></span>.
        The <span class="code">Enumerator</span> interface differs from the C# language interface of the same name by providing a simplified functionality.
        The Cminor <span class="code">Enumerator</span> interface has three functions instead of two: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="code">AtEnd()</span> should return <span class="code"><strong>true</strong></span> if the sequence of elements is empty or already enumerated,
                <span class="code"><strong>false</strong></span> otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">GetCurrent()</span> should return the current element as an object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">MoveNext()</span> should move the enumerator one position forward in the sequence to be enumerated.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        The <span class="code">Print()</span> member function of the <span class="code">SymbolTable</span> class above uses enumerator interface implicitly to enumerate
        all the variables in the map, because the <strong>foreach</strong> statement is implemented in terms of <span class="code">Enumerable</span> and 
        <span class="code">Enumerator</span> interfaces: statement <span class="code"><strong>foreach</strong> (Type x <strong>in</strong> collection) { statement; }</span> 
        is lowered by the compiler to the following code:
        <div class="program">

        </div>
    </p>

    <h3 id="parser">
        7.8 Implementing a Parser
    </h3>

    <p>
        A parser can be implemented by hand as functions that call each other possibly recursively. 
        This kind of parser is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent</a> parser.
        The syntax of arithmetic expressions we are parsing is as follows:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/syntax.cminor.html" height="100px" width="720px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        We will write each production as a nonmember function that returns the value of the parsed subexpression.
        Here's the <span class="code">Expr()</span> function that corresponds to the <span class="code">&lt;expr&gt;</span> production.
        It parses <span class="code">&lt;term&gt;</span>s separated by '+' and '-' characters:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/expr.cminor.html" height="480px" width="720px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        The expression "<span class="code">x <strong>as</strong> C</span>" is functionally equavalent to the similar C# language construct:
        If class of <span class="code">x</span> is class <span class="code">C</span> or derived from <span class="code">C</span> the 
        result of the <span class="code"><strong>as</strong></span> expression is <span class="code">x</span> converted to 
        <span class="code">C</span>, otherwise it is <span class="code"><strong>null</strong></span>.
        The class-of test is implemented using similar integer divisibility expression in terms of class identifiers as for the 
        <span class="code"><strong>is</strong></span>-expression.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's the <span class="code">Term()</span> function that corresponds to the  <span class="code">&lt;term&gt;</span> production.
        It parses <span class="code">&lt;factors&gt;</span>s separated by '*' and '/' characters:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/term.cminor.html" height="540px" width="720px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        The <span class="code">&lt;factor&gt;</span> production is implemented by the following <span class="code">Factor()</span> function.
        It parses <span class="code">&lt;primaries&gt;</span> prefixed by '+' and '-' signs:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/factor.cminor.html" height="360px" width="720px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        Here comes finally the implementation of the <span class="code">&lt;primary&gt;</span> production.
        It parses numbers, variable names and subexpressions:
    </p>

    <div class="program">
        <iframe src="../code/dc/primary.cminor.html" height="740px" width="720px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
        When the primary starts with the left parenthesis the <span class="code">Primary</span> function calls the <span class="code">Expr</span>
        function to parse a subexpression recursively.
    </p>

    <p>
        That closes up the calculator example. Here's the entire source code for the parser portion of the example:
