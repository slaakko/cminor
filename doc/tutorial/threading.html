    <p>
        This chapter is devoted to <a href="../code/system/Thread.cminor.html">threads</a>, <a href="../code/system/Monitor.cminor.html">locks</a> and

        9.1 The Program
    </h3>

    <p>
        The following program creates twice as many output threads as there are cores in the machine. 
        Each output thread generates ten times a hello message in its main function <span class="code">OutputThreadMain()</span>. 
        The program has also an output collector class whose <span class="code">Run()</span> method is also run in a thread.
        The output threads insert their output lines to the end of the collector's <span class="code">outputLines</span> list 
        by calling the output collector's <span class="code">WriteLine()</span> method.
    </p>

    <p>
        The collector's <span class="code">outputLines</span> member variable is an ordinary <span class="code">List&lt;string&gt;</span>,
        that is not synchronized by default. Therefore we need a lock object, <span class="code">outputLock</span>, that 
        synchronizes access to the <span class="code">outputLines</span> list by using lock statements.
    </p>

    <p>
        After an output thread has added its message to the end of the <span class="code">outputLines</span> list it also notifies a
        condition variable <span class="code">outputAvailableOrExiting</span>, that wakes up the output collector. 
        The output collector removes messages from the head of the <span class="code">outputLines</span> list, prints them to the console, 
        and goes back to sleep waiting for more lines to output or <span class="code">exiting</span> variable to become true.
</p>

    <p>
        It may happen that many output threads manage to insert their output to the output lines before the collector wakes up,
        so that there may be more output lines than collector wake ups, so the collector empties the list each time it wakes up.
    </p>

    <div class="program">

    </div>

    <p>
        The main function of the program consists of starting the output collector thread and the output threads,
        then waiting that the output threads end, and finally signaling the exiting condition to the collector and 
        waiting that the collector thread ends.

        Here's the output of the program when run on my machine, that has four cores:
