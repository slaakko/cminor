    <p>
        Cminor is quite a small language whose core statements and expressions are identical with statements and expressions in C#.
        Cminor does not contain all the features of current C#. 
        However it is not a proper subset of C# either because Cminor has non-member functions and C# does not, for example.
        One can say that Cminor and C# are siblings and C# is the big brother or sister of Cminor.

    <p>
        Cminor programs are compiled to Cminor virtual machine instructions and so run in a virtual machine.
        Cminor programs are garbage-collected so there's no need for manual memory management.

        1.1 Motivation
    </h3>

    <p>
        Motivation for creating this language was just to have fun and experiment with virtual machine architecture and garbage collection.

        1.2 Cminor System Library
    </h3>

    <p>
        The Cminor System Library has borrowed many classes from .NET Framework but the same relationship exists with Cminor System Library
        and .NET Framework as the relationship with Cminor and C#: the .NET Framework is the big brother of Cminor System Library.
